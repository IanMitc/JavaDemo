# Constructor
1. It is a special function which get called whenever we create object of the class
2. Constructor are use to initialize the class variables
3. every class which object we want to create must have a constructor
4. if we dont provide constructor for a class compiler will create a default constructor

# Type of constructor
1. default or parameter less constructor
2. parametrized constructor
3. copy constructor
4. static constructor

# Constructor overloading
to have more then one constructor in a class
we have to differentiate constructors on basic of parameters

1. different number of parameters
2. different type of parameters
3. different order of parameters


# OOPs 4 main pillers
1. Inheritence
2. Polymorphism
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation


# Inheritence 

DRY - Dont Repeat yourself

> It is a mechanism of consuming members of one class in another class by eastablishing parent and child 
  relationship between the classes
> it encourages the code reusability
> we have relation between the class using extend keyword

Employee   -> Parent / base / super
FullTimeEmployee -> child / derived / sub

> in inheritence child class can consume members of its parent class as it is the owner of those members
except private members of the parent class
> Parent class constructor must be accessible to the child class otherwise inheritence will not be possible
> in inheritence child class can access parent class members but parent class cannot access any member of the 
  child class

# Advantages
- code resuablity
- reduce error
- reduce time
- more maintable code


# Type of inheritence
1. Simple
2. Multi-Level
3. Hirarchical
4. Multiple
5. Hybrid
