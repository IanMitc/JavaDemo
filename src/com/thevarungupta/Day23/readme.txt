# Components

- In React, a component represent a part of user interface
- whatever is visible on the web page is a component. we can put components together to make a bigger component
- components are reusable and make the application more modular

# Type of component
1. functional components
2. class components


# Function component
- functional components are also known as Stateless (data) component 
- they work like a javascript function which accept props as an argument
- they do not have their own state
- they return valid JSX / react element

# Class component
- class component are more complex component and conceptually behave as classes introduce in ES6
- are also know as statefull componments
- manage their own state


# Functional vs Class component
- usually created as statefull, but can be stateless as well
- require render() function to return React element 
- being stateful make use of life cycle method

- always stateless before v16
- do not require use of addtional render() function
- lifecycle method cannot be involved  with use of functional component as they are stateless


# React Props and State

# Props
- React props are like function arguments in javascript and attributes in HTML
- Props are the arguments passed in React components
- props are passes to components view HTML attribute
